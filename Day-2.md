## 📘 Day 2 – Learning Log  

**📅 Date:** 13/02/2026  

### 📌 Overview  
Today, I took a leave from college to dedicate focused time to strengthening my core Java fundamentals and improving my programming logic.

### 📚 Topics Covered  

- Taking input from the user using the `Scanner` class  
- Conditional statements (`if-else`, `switch-case`)  
- Logical operators (`&&`, `||`)  
- Loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`)  
- Pattern printing using nested loops  
- Functions and methods  
- Introduction to Time Complexity  
- Introduction to Space Complexity

### ❌ Challenges Faced  
- Needed additional practice to clearly understand nested loops  
- Time complexity concepts are still at a beginner level  

---

### ✅ Outcome  
Improved control over loops and conditional logic. Pattern problems significantly enhanced my logical thinking and understanding of flow control.

### 🚀 Target for 14/02/2026  
- Arrays  
- 2D Arrays  
- Strings  
- Strengthen fundamentals to move closer to structured DSA practice
