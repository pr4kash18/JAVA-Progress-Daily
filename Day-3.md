## 📘 Day 3 – Learning Log  

**📅 Date:** 14/02/2026  

### 📌 Overview  
Today, I did not start any new topics. Instead, I focused on practicing previously learned concepts by writing multiple programs to strengthen my fundamentals and improve logical clarity.

### 📚 Practice Programs  

#### 🔹 If-Else Programs  
- Check whether a number is even or odd  
- Check whether a number is positive, negative, or zero  
- Find the largest of two numbers  
- Find the largest of three numbers  
- Check whether a year is a leap year  
- Check whether a number is divisible by 5 and 11  
- Check whether a number is prime  
- Check whether a number is a multiple of both 3 and 7  
- Calculate student grade based on marks  
- Check whether a person is eligible to vote

- Print day name using day number (1–7)  
- Print month name using month number (1–12)  
- Create a simple calculator (add, subtract, multiply, divide)  
- Print number of days in a month  

---

#### 🔹 For Loop Programs  
- Print numbers from 1 to 10  
- Print numbers from 10 to 1  
- Print even numbers from 1 to 50  
- Print odd numbers from 1 to 50

#### 🔹 Pattern Programs  
- Right triangle star pattern  
- Inverted triangle pattern  
- Pyramid star pattern  
- Number triangle pattern  
- Hollow square pattern  
- Diamond star pattern

### ❌ Challenges Faced  
I experienced significant difficulty and frustration while solving star pattern problems. Nested loops and alignment logic were challenging to understand, and I still do not feel fully confident with pattern problems. However, I will continue practicing and improving.
